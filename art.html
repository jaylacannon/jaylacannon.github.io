  <P>In art class we were told to pick something that would spread a mood in the school.</P>
  <p>My group and I picked a happy box. Inside we were going to give out happy faces with nice things on the back of them.</p>

        <h3>ART INSTALLATION</h3>
        <p>The purpose of our project was to make people happy when they seen it. It was to put them in a happy or relaxed mood. At first i didn't think the box would be a success because of some of the complations we were having. However It was successful because when people took a nice circle the audience had a positive reaction.  
</p>
<P>I contributed by coming up with the idea of the happy box. I created the circles and positive quotes on them. I helped make the pieces of the box. Cutting, measuring and drilling the wood. I helped paint the box and everyday i was doing something to progressively finish the project. </P>
<P>A Lot of things went well with this project. My favorite part was how we all played a part in creating the product. My group finished on time so that definitely worked well. Everyone agreed on one thing and there wasn't any conflict. 
</P>
<P>Something I would change is how when we came across problems we just ignored them. I feel if we would've took the time out to fix the smaller problems it would look better. Such as drilling and cutting the wood. If we would've made sure all the pieces were all equal, it would've had a better outcome.
</P>
<P>I learned that little things can make people happy or make them feel better. I learned that teamwork is important when creating something like what we did. I learned to listen to everyone's ideas and add them into the finale project. I now know that some little things can make a difference in someone's day. </P>
